Semantic HTML refers to HTML that uses meaningful tags to clearly define the purpose and structure of web content. For example, instead of using generic tags like <div> or <span>, semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, <nav>, and <section> are used to describe the role of the content within the page.

Importance of Semantic HTML:
Improved Accessibility: Semantic HTML helps assistive technologies, like screen readers, understand and navigate the structure of a webpage more effectively.
SEO Benefits: Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the context and relevance of content, which can improve search rankings.
Readability: It enhances code readability for developers, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on web projects.
Standards Compliance: It aligns with web standards, contributing to more consistent behavior across different browsers.
In short, semantic HTML improves both the user experience and website performance by creating a more structured, accessible, and search-engine-friendly web page.
